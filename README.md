This is the code I use for the introduction to bid data analysis, which is a class I teach at Konrad Lorenz University for people who are interested in learning how to program in R for data analysis. 

It's a really basic code, based on the book "CIENCIA DE DATOS CON R" and some other information like dyplyer, sentiment analysis, word clouds, and more. 

if you are pretty new to the data analysis I would recommend you to read this information, it's really basic and easy to understand... 

clearance: it's not finished, so I'm continuously adding new information. 

Datascience topics on this document:

Basic learning. (variables, vectores, lists....)

Dyplyer. (basic comands to understand a dataframe)

Tweeter scraping information. (How to call and use tweeter packages in R)

Sentiment analyses in spanish language. (its possible to get in other 7 languages too)

DataMining (how to make descriptive analyses with R)
