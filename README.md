This is the code I use for the "introduction to big data analysis", which is a class I teach at Konrad Lorenz University for people who are interested in learning how to program in R for data analysis. 

It's a really basic code, based on the book "CIENCIA DE DATOS CON R" and some other information like dyplyer, sentiment analysis, word clouds, and more. 

if you are pretty new to the data analysis I would recommend you to read this information, it's really basic and easy to understand... 

clearance: it's not finished, so I'm continuously adding new information. 
clearance: As my students are fom Bogota - Colombia, the code is in spanish. If you are interested in the code uou can always translate it to english or your own language.
